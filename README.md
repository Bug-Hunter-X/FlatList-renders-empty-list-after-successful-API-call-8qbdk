# React Native FlatList rendering issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call. The bug is present in `DataList.js`, while the solution is provided in `DataListSolution.js`.

## Problem

The `DataList` component fetches data from a sample API endpoint. Despite a successful fetch and data retrieval, the FlatList remains empty. This issue could stem from improper data handling or an incorrect FlatList configuration.

## Solution

The `DataListSolution.js` file contains the corrected code. This version addresses potential issues like asynchronous data updates and improper FlatList key extraction, ensuring accurate data rendering within the FlatList.
